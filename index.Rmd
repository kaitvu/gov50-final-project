## Project Thoughts

I am interested in exploring data related to public opinion on the Supreme Court, especially given the recent decisions on abortion, affirmative action, and environmental regulations. How have popular views/ratings of the Supreme Court changed over the past decade or so? How do these opinions differ by age, partisan ideology, education, location, specific political issues, etc?
